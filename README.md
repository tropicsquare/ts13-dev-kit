# About

TS13 – TROPIC01 USB Development Kit
A KiCad-based hardware project providing a minimal development platform for the TROPIC01 chip.

The TS13 features a USB-C interface and an STM32 microcontroller acting as a USB-to-SPI converter,
enabling straightforward host communication with TROPIC01.

For firmware details and usage instructions, see the `ts-usb-dev-kit-fw.git` README.
